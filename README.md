# MINECRAFT OPENGL

## Windows port TODO list

[ ] Full blown port rework (handmade hero style) OR patch it up until it is functional
[ ] Build batch file for building project
[ ] Moving all external dependencies to the repo so the bare minimum depends on the OS

this seems all, it should not be that difficult LETS GO!!
